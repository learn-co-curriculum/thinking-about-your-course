## Your Course Outline 

You’re an expert in your topic. You’ve worked professionally in it and might even have published books or articles about it as well. And that’s why we’re working with you to develop curriculum!

But creating a course, writing an outline, and developing your syllabus for students on the topic that you know so well requires you to think differently and from the perspective of a learner. 

Here at Flatiron and Learn, we take students at the very beginning of their programming journey and train them to land jobs as developers. Our curriculum therefore is beginner friendly and never intimidating. Difficult, yes, but not intimidating and we put this guide together so that you can take your expertise and translate it into compelling lessons that are fun, engaging, and actually help students learn. In other words, you won't be writing glorified documentation but instead, lessons that tell a story, guide students through discovery, and challenge them.
